### Key concepts

- Low detail ideas => wireframes => high detail components
- Two step process:
	- Generate the idea => Sketch (repeat)
	- Add detail => Refine (repeat)

Generate as many ideas you can, just basic sketch with low details. Slowly refine by adding details and creating wireframes with more UI elements. As wireframe becomes more detailed you can focus on certain elements or exact components. Start thinking more about how user interacts with the UI.

- who is your audience, think about them first. what are your goals?
- give yourself time limits. don't waste time on details.
- draw device frame to guide your sketch.
- start with simple elements like footer or header from bigger picture.

- annotate your sketches, attach explanations for your future self.
- keep going, sketch as many as you can.
