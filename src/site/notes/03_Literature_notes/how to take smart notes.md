## Introduction

When writing about any kind of topic it is harder to start with blank slate and go directly from thoughts to paper. Start with notes and go from there.

Key to successful writing lies in good preparation.

Self discipline is hard to achieve with pure willpower. Willpower depletes quickly and is very limited. Every task that is interesting and meaningful will be done if workflow rules are well defined. When there is no conflict between short term interest and long term interest, having meaningful and well defined task beats willpower every time.

This is where organisation of writing and note taking comes into play.

## Everything you need to know

Good structure is something you can trust. It relieves you from the burden of remembering and keeping track of everything. If you can trust the system, you can let go of the attempt to hold everything in your head. Good structure enables you to completely immerse yourself in a state of flow.
