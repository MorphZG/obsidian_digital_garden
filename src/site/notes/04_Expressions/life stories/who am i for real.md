# Who am i for real

![](_assets/who_am_i.png)

Young, naive and overconfident. Now, 36 years of age, frustrated but highly motivated. I thought success will come by default but was wrong. I always felt confident with skills and value i offer to my employee. bartender since 2005 till now. and i was sure i am a good one. but after my 30 birthday i started to question. somehow i realized i have other skills and interests that none of my colleagues have. In more than a decade of my bartending None of my work buddies. few more years have passed and i am now sure i am different. i just don’t fit into the stereotype.

Started to wonder. who am i actually? my natural talent. some born as warriors, some as bards, musicians and others as clowns. Who am i? And i found the answer. What you do in your free time? That is career for you. Ever since high school technology was around me. While friends just play the games. I always tried to find how mechanics work? How damage is calculated? How to get highest value with minimal effort. And just like that my head bulb was lit. i love code, i love exploiting the system rules to get optimal results. never really a math guy but mechanics in the background.

When i started coding in visual studio i got access to simplified git interface. I had urge to learn how all those components work together. Launch the terminal and learn git, learn bash and linux scripting… like puzzles connecting and forming a picture. I realized the backend for web apps is my perfect fit. But then came machine learning and all those really challenging stuff years ahead of me. Currently to high above my level. With 36 i think i am now more than ready to take that bite.
