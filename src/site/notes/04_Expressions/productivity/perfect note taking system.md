# Perfect note taking system

## Tweaking and configuring until you make it

I’ve been down the rabbit hole of finding the perfect tool. It started innocently enough—I was searching for a text editor that could do it all. I tried everything from Evernote to Notion, but then I discovered the text editor that built a huge legacy over the decades of existence, Vim. Text editor you can run on a pocket calculator if it had a few more buttons but also so customisable and extensible you can do some serious work with it. While it's modern brother Neovim ruling the scene these days only sky is the limit.

I could customise every little detail, configure countless plugins, scripts and themes available i can make it exactly how I want. I’d lose hours tweaking settings and refining my setup, convinced I was being productive just because I was working something. It felt like I was really accomplishing something, and i actually did have really cool piece of a tool. But it was not what i initially went for.

I had a beautifully customised text editor that could handle anything i throw at it. But i had zero content, zero or almost zero output. Most of my time had been spent fiddling with configurations rather than getting things done. Like most of you i was scammed, by my own surplus of creativity combined with a lack of courage. That’s when it hit me: I wasn’t really moving forward. I was just spinning my wheels, obsessing over the system instead of the work. Being active on reddit.com i found many lost souls looking for a system, how to do it right. It is not about doing it right, you just have to start and you won't be wrong.

## Why are we scared to start without having a system?

So, why do we get so hung up on finding the perfect note-taking system before we even start? For many of us, it’s about control. Starting something new, like switching careers or diving into a new field, can be intimidating. We crave a sense of order, something that will guide us through the chaos. Having a system feels like having a map in uncharted territory—it’s reassuring. But here’s the problem: spending too much time on the map means you never actually start the journey.

We’re scared that if we don’t have a system, we’ll mess up. We’ll forget something important, miss a critical detail, or simply feel overwhelmed by the sheer volume of information. But in reality, the only way to overcome that fear is to dive in, messy and unorganised as it might be. The system can come later.

## Do we need a system?

Here’s where things get interesting: you don’t really need a system to get started. I know, it sounds counterintuitive. But think about it, some of the most successful people in the world didn’t start with a flawless system. They started with passion, curiosity, and a willingness to learn. The system was something they developed over time, based on what actually worked for them.

In fact, obsessing over a system before you even begin can be more of a hindrance than a help. You’re putting the cart before the horse, worrying about the structure when you should be focusing on the content. Notes, after all, are just a tool to help you capture and organise your thoughts. The real value lies in what you’re learning, not how you’re organising it.

## Start with content, and the system will come

So, where should you begin? Start with the content. Write, scribble,  note what you’re learning, just save what seems important. Why you think it's important? Where you found the information? Think about how would you search for it when you need it. There is a search tool in any app you use, so help your future self and make the information easy to find by adding tags or keywords. Still no need for complex directory structure, keep everything together and just use search tool. If you are adding tags try not to go crazy with to many tags. Tags should be specific with no more than 3 or 4 tags per note, otherwise they loose the purpose. The point here is to help you find the information later.

As you accumulate more notes, patterns will naturally start to emerge. You’ll begin to see what works and what doesn’t. Maybe you’ll notice that certain tools or methods help you retain information better. That’s when you can start to develop your own system, tailored to your needs. The key is to let the system evolve organically, rather than forcing it.

## Don’t stress too much

It’s easy to get caught up in the idea that you need to have everything figured out from day one. But here’s a little secret: nobody does. Whether you’re starting a new career, learning a new skill, or just trying to keep track of your grocery list, the perfect system is one that grows with you.

Don’t stress if your notes look like a chaotic mess at first. The important thing is that you’re capturing information and learning. The organisation will come with time, as you refine what works for you. Remember, the goal is progress, not perfection.

## Conclusion: Embrace the mess and keep moving

In the end, the perfect note-taking system is a myth. There is no one system to rule them all even when it seem like it. There are many templates and workflows available online but at the end you will notice how you can combine different ideas with your creativity and your own personal preference. In the end you will naturally start following a pattern you like and enjoy, your own personal workflow should not restrain you but help you to grow. The real magic happens when you let go of the need for perfection and simply focus on what is actually important. Start with the content, and allow your system to evolve slowly. Embrace the messiness, the trial and error, and the inevitable tweaks along the way.
