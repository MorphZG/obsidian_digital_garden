# TODO index

This note will serve as a list of different themes, concepts or ideas i would like to explore further. The main idea is the following... I am watching, reading or listening some long form content like a podcast, documentary or an article. While doing so i find something interesting i would like to learn more about but as i am currently consuming a long form content i cannot or i don't want to stop and jump around the world wide web. Instead of jumping from content to content i will use this index to write down the concept or idea i would like to explore later.

If i complete one of the following TODO's, should i remove it from the list? I think i should and i probably will. But let's see the natural flow when i actually start completing more of them.

## Mojsije razdvaja crveno more

Moderna znanost nudi nekoliko **prirodnih objašnjenja** za događaj razdvajanja mora koji se tradicionalno veže uz Mojsija i Izlazak Izraelaca, a koji je opisan u Bibliji kao Božja intervencija.
- Djelovanje vjetra (Wind Setdown) preko plitkog jezera poput Jezera trske (Reed Sea), alternativan prjevod je Crveno more (Red sea). Mozda je Crveno More zapravo vrlo plitko Jezero Trske.
