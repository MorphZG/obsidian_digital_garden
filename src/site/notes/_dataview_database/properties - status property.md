# properties - status property

## Explanation of status property

> <span style="color: orange; font-size:12">For these lists to display correct information you need to install `dataview` plugin</span>

Stage of maturity or completeness of a note. Available values sorted from early stage to late stage:

- `draft`: Fresh note, still in early stage writing.
- `useful`: Can be considered a semi-completed work. It can be useful but still lacks information or content.
- `detailed`: Completed note. With proper content and metadata. This can be considered as a full text ready to be published if needed.
- `master`: Notes in very late stage. After enough time has passed and all the ideas covered and explored. It must build upon the previous stage and provide additional value.
- `archived`: Archived notes are deprecated or obsolete. Such notes will hold the archived status to serve as a reminder that even the bad or failed ideas have a purpose and we should not be afraid of failure. Failure is just a bump on the road.

#### Status: draft

Fresh note, still in early stage writing.

Notes still in a form of a placeholder or not not really useful. Provides zero value.

#### Status: archived

Failure is just a bump on the road.

I will never delete the note but often i realise there is no point in continuing the work or maybe the idea is just bad. Such notes will hold the `archived` status. Maybe one day someone brings them back to the surface.
