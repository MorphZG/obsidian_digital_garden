# Start here

## Welcome my friend

- **If you completed the setup instructions found in main [[README\|README]] file, this should be your first real interaction with my knowledge base**

I was looking for a way to turn my markdown notes into a static website, collection of knowledge and memories available for anyone. I am still experimenting with different static site generators but i also learn a lot about web development in general. As my knowledge base grows i will probably go through different methods of publishing.

## Don't be ashamed to publish online

I am in a process of building my own web from the ground up but for now i use [Digital Garden plugin](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/) I guarantee you there is no easier way to publish your Obsidian notes. If you decide to try it out be sure to create separate github token with restricted access to the rest of your github account. Of course i don't have to mention that having basic knowledge git version control and a [github.com](https://www.github.com) account is mandatory. Maybe you can try with alternative git platform like [gitlab.com](https://www.gitlab.com). So... For plugin to work you need a github token that will grant the restricted access to your remote repository. Would be smart to make a copy of your main vault and use the copy for publishing. The plugin requires some additional frontmatter properties for each note, if you are like me than you don't want your original vault to have those. For me it's just aesthetic issue. If you need detailed guidance please refer to official documentation of the plugin: [Digital Garden plugin](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/)

## If you need the guiding hand

For all of you out there that do not have an Obsidian installed and you have zero knowledge of note taking and concepts like "Digital garden" or "Knowledge management" are completely unknown to you than please refer to this little file here: [[README\|README.md]] If you ever used a site like [wikipedia.org](https://www.wikipedia.org) than you will be familiar with "Digital gardens" and Obsidian vaults where knowledge is organised as a set of markdown files or markdown notes. Different concepts, ideas or themes can be interconnected with links to other notes connecting everything into a huge web of knowledge or **Second Brain[^1]** as many of us will refer to it.

## Set the workflow rules

Now back to my story. If you are looking for some starting point of this particular knowledge base, or this particular digital garden, you may start with my [[_workflow\|workflow rules]]. I have composed a set of rules to help me organise the content. I hate restricting my creative output so the workflow should move my focus away from where to put the note, how to set the tags and metadata, how to format the note... and keep my focus on the actual content. With the rules in place i can keep my focus on content instead of structure.

## Building the index

One of the helpful, even essential plugins is the `dataview`. It allows you to query your vault using very simple syntax and return the notes containing the particular metadata. As an example, each note have a `status` property. I can write simple query which will return all notes where `status` = `draft` and show me which notes need my attention. Check out the [[_dataview_database/index\|dataview index]] and it's directory for a list of notes and properties i have.

## Now, let me tell you a story

A simple guy, nothing special about him, not much different from the other regulars you see in public. But.... that's just on surface, inside, every single one of us is very special. Living through unique experiences that shapes who we are. First love, first disappointment, first school fight.... Very early in life we start to diverge in unimaginable ways from each other but still, somehow, we are drawn to other people with similar interests.

I like to stay occupied, i enjoy being productive. Sometimes finding fun where others would get bored to death. That's the reason i write. I like writing.  Writing is more than just an escape or a way to pass the time. It's a reflection, a conversation with myself. Each word is like pulling back a layer, exposing thoughts I didn’t even know I had. It's strange, really, how putting pen to paper or fingers to keyboard can bring out emotions you didn’t realise were hiding beneath the surface.

I often think about the power of storytelling. How, with the right words, you can capture an entire moment, a fleeting feeling, or a lifetime of experiences. When I write, I'm not just telling a story; I'm weaving a piece of myself into it. Sometimes it's about people I've met, situations I've been in. Sometimes it's just pure imagination, creating worlds and characters that don’t exist, yet somehow feel more real than anything around me.

There’s something thrilling about it, like I’m both the creator and the observer. I write to understand, to make sense of the chaos that sometimes spins in my head. And if, by chance, my words resonate with someone else, if they read something I’ve written and feel even a fraction of what I felt while writing it than i did a good job.

But that’s the thing about sharing your thoughts no matter how personal they feel, you never know who might connect with them

##### Footnotes

[^1]: The "Second Brain" is a methodological framework for capturing, organizing, and retrieving everything you learn and create, essentially moving mental effort out of your head and into a trusted external digital system. The system utilising Obsidian is based on interconnected files (like a wiki or a knowledge graph) rather than rigid, hierarchical directories.
